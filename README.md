Browser based Fastly Health Check report. 

Requirements
1. No Python
2. No set up / install procedures
3. No pyenv scripts
4. Just a web browser and api token.

Directions
1. Open sigsights.html from file in a web browser. CORS protection must be bypassed. Safari seems to work well.
2. Copy and paste in the dstoken and duo token from a salt browser session (lines ~788/789). (Alternately, there is commented out code to use a x-api-user and x-api-token headers).
3. Enjoy!
